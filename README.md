# CoinsLite

A web app where collectors record the coins, banknotes and stamps they own, organise them, and track what they paid and what they're worth.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/app` | Product app (Next.js), port 3000 |
| `apps/web` | Marketing site (Next.js), port 3001 |
| `packages/backend` | Convex backend: schema, functions, auth, billing |
| `packages/ui` | Shared UI components (shadcn/Tailwind) |
| `packages/email` | Email templates (React Email), preview on port 3003 |
| `tooling/e2e` | Playwright smoke tests |
| `tooling/typescript` | Shared TypeScript config |

## Getting started

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```sh
bun install
bun run setup   # configures a Convex deployment and points the app at it
bun dev         # marketing site, product app, Convex and email preview
```

`bun run setup` asks you to log in to Convex, or to start without an account and run Convex locally. Agents and CI can skip the prompt with `CONVEX_AGENT_MODE=anonymous bun run setup`.

## Checks

```sh
bun run lint        # Biome + monorepo consistency
bun run typecheck
bun run test        # backend rules, through Convex functions (convex-test + Vitest)
bun run test:e2e    # Playwright smoke tests; starts both apps if they aren't running
```

The first Playwright run needs a browser: `bunx playwright install chromium`.

CI runs all four on every push and pull request.
